# TEC-COMM
Universal hobby project remote control app.

TEC-COMM is an Android open-source project whose goal is to provide a simple, clean interface for interacting with Arduino hobby robots through bluetooth or other communications protocols.  The vision is to have a user experience in which a user creates a device profile for a particular robot they want to control, then configures one or many communication avenues that will link the Android to that robot.  The pioneering interface will be Bluetooth, but I intend on adding Wifi, NFC, and perhaps IR for supporting hardware.  Eventually I hope to add customizeable UI elements that can be used as a virtual controller (much like a console remote).

If this seems like a project that you would be interested in contributing to, feel free to contact me at codewhisperer97@gmail.com
