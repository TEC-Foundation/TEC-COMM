# TEC-COMM
Universal hobby project remote control app.

TEC-COMM is an Android open-source project whose goal is to provide a unifying interface for
communicating with electronic projects.  It offers a wide range of connection options, including
reconfigurable Bluetooth and TCP/IP.  Data can be represented as String, Hex, or Binary, and
arranged into pre-established commands that can be easily repeated or tweaked.
